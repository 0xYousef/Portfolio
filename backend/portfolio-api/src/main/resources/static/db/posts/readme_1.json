Modern e-commerce platforms must handle high traffic, manage complex product data, and ensure smooth customer experiences. To achieve this, many teams adopt microservices architecture powered by Spring Boot and Kafka."

      "text": "In a typical e-commerce system, each module can be a standalone service — for example, Product Service, Inventory Service, Order Service, and Payment Service. Each service has its own database, logic, and API. This separation makes it easy to update one service without affecting the others."
